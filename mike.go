His latest, “Gods, Guns, Grits and Gravy”, was released in January, just as Mr Huckabee suspended his show on Fox News to prepare his bid for the Republican nomination for presidency. This evening he appeared on Fox News to declare that he will formally announce on May 6<sup>th</sup> his intention to run. But Mr Huckabee’s chances of winning are so remote that a cynic might presume his real intention is to sell more books.</p><p>Mr Huckabee’s pitch is for the religious vote. A southern Baptist minister, he is fiercely—indeed occasionally absurdly—socially conservative. He once compared the idea that Christians should accept gay marriage to being “like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli”. Last year he argued that legal abortion is worse than the Holocaust. In his book, he complains that Jay Z, a rapper, has moved from being a “husband to pimp by exploiting his wife [Beyoncé, a pop star] as a sex object”.</p><p>[inline|iid=85274]</p><p>In the past, that made him a credible candidate. In the 2008 race he almost caused an upset, winning not only Iowa (where Republican caucuses are dominated by religious conservatives) but also Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Tennessee and West Virginia. In the end, he finished behind both John McCain, the eventual candidate, and Mitt Romney, but his religious conservatism rattled both. Religious conservatives are not a majority in America, but for Mr Huckabee they turned out in huge numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>His chances now are slimmer. Then, the race’s front-runners were more conventional and not especially religious. This time around, he faces competition for the evangelical vote from Ted Cruz, a firebrand Texan senator, Rand Paul, a libertarian senator who makes much of his religion, and Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, who, like Mr Huckabee, refuses to admit whether or not he believes in the theory of evolution. Though a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2014/09/22/public-sees-religions-influence-waning-2/\" target=\"_blank\">growing share</a>&nbsp;of voters believe religion should play a bigger role in politics, there is no shortage of faithful candidates in 2016.</p><p>Can Mr Huckabee cause an upset anyway? It seems unlikely. He has some dedicated followers, but he has not spent much time in Iowa or New Hampshire, key early states. Nor has he built up much of a staff. Crucially, few Republicans take him seriously. Whereas the other contenders hold offices—and in the case of at least a few, have won competitive elections in recent years—Mr Huckabee has mostly spent his time working on Fox News as a commentator. This has paid him well, but it does not much contribute to a successful campaign. He also sat out the 2012 race, explaining that the job of president was too demanding to pursue without “God’s full blessing”.</p><p>So why run? Well, apart from selling books, Mr Huckabee’s presence could well force the other candidates to the right, at least if they feel that he may siphon away the votes of religious conservatives.
